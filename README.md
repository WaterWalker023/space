# SpacePus

## You are on expedition in your spaceship and you see that earth is being attacked by a huge octopus

## You turned back immediatly and began attacking the octopus to try and save the earth

### You approach the octopus, it begins attacking you when he notices you. You shoot back and try your best to kill him, but he sends mini octopuses towards you. You defeated them with your weapons and now the octopus escapes to another planet. You guys are happy for a few minutes, until you realise that the planet that the octopus went to is inhabited by other lifeforms. The octopus got really mad after they saw you coming towards him, he unleashed an even greater amount of octopuses. You defeated them yet again, the octopus ran away again since he knew he couldnt defeat you in his current state. After a day of staying on that planet you see the octopus even more powerful than before and attacking a new planent. You fly towards it as fast as possible but he is prepared. You try kill all the octopuses he sends towards you, but its too much. You try and use 50% of your remaining energy to activate a wave blast defeating all the mini octopuses. The big octopus got really mad and attacked you himself. After a heavy battle you defeated the octopus by dodging all his attacks. After a few weeks of the battle, the lifeforms from the other planets gave you the title of savior of the universe
